Create a comprehensive icon specification for our Next.js application using lucide-react. Include:

1. Icon naming conventions following Lucide's camelCase pattern
2. Standard sizes (16px, 20px, 24px, 32px) and stroke widths (1.5px, 2px)
3. Color usage: currentColor for theming, specific hex codes for branded elements
4. Accessibility: proper ARIA labels, focus states, screen reader support
5. Usage guidelines for common components (buttons, navigation, forms, status indicators)
6. Custom icon creation rules matching Lucide's clean, minimal aesthetic
7. Performance optimization: tree-shaking, lazy loading, SVG optimization
8. Consistency checks: stroke caps, joins, and geometric precision

Reference lucide-react v0.544.0 documentation for implementation details and ensure all icons are scalable vector graphics optimized for web delivery.
